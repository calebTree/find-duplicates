# find-duplicates
A batch script that finds duplicate files using SHA1 comparison in the current working directory and subdirectories.

Does not work in a root directory i.e. C:\\>, F:\\>, etc..

Easily confused by abnormal characters in filenames yet appears not to destroy the sesson or make the results completely useless.
